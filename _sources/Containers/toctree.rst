Container Data Types
:::::::::::::::::::::


In addition to the numeric, Boolean, and character types,
C++ also offers `built-in container <https://www.cplusplus.com/reference/stl/>`_ types.
A **container** data type is a grouping of some number of other data items
(possibly only zero or one) that have some shared significance
or need to be operated upon together.

C++ containers are implemented using two advanced topics ( :ref:`Namespaces` and :ref:`Templates` )
but using containers is fairly simple.
